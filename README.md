# PHP AI and LLM Library

This library provides a single, unified, framework-independent library for integration with several popular AI providers and large language models.

## Installation

Install the library using Composer:

```console
composer require 1tomany/php-ai
```

### Symfony Bundle

A [Symfony bundle](https://github.com/1tomany/php-ai-bundle) is available if you wish to integrate this library into your Symfony applications with autowiring and configuration support.

## Supported platforms

- Gemini
- OpenAI

### Platform features

| Feature              | Gemini | OpenAI |
| -------------------- | :----: | :----: |
| **Files**            |        |        |
| Upload               |   ✅   |   ✅   |
| Delete               |   ✅   |   ✅   |
| **Queries**          |        |        |
| Compile              |   ✅   |   ✅   |
| Run                  |   ✅   |   ✅   |
| **Search stores**    |        |        |
| Create               |   ✅   |   ✅   |
| Read with statistics |   ✅   |   ✅   |
| Delete               |   ✅   |   ✅   |
| Attach file          |   ✅   |   ✅   |
| Read attached file   |   ✅   |   ✅   |
| Delete attached file |   ✅   |   ✅   |

Search stores and their attached files are exposed as separate resource facades:

```php
$searchStore = $aiClient->searchStores->create('openai', 'Documentation');
$searchStore = $aiClient->searchStores->read('openai', $searchStore->id);

$searchStoreFile = $aiClient->searchStores->files->attach(
    'openai',
    $searchStore->id,
    $remoteFile->id,
    ['section' => 'reference'],
);
$searchStoreFile = $aiClient->searchStores->files->read(
    'openai',
    $searchStore->id,
    $searchStoreFile->id,
);

$aiClient->searchStores->files->delete('openai', $searchStore->id, $searchStoreFile->id);
$aiClient->searchStores->delete('openai', $searchStore->id);
```

**Note:** Each platform refers to generating output - inference - differently: OpenAI uses "Response", Gemini uses "Interaction", and Anthropic uses "Message". I've decided the word "Query" best represents how you interact with a generative LLM: you compile a query and then run the query to generate a response. The word "Embedding" will continue to be used for embedding models.

To generate a response, you must first compile a query. A query is made up of different input components: text prompts, files, a JSON schema, and/or system instructions. Once the query is compiled, it can be sent to the LLM for inference.

This library allows you to compile a query before sending it to the model for two reasons:

1. You can log/analyze the request payload before sending it.
2. You can compile individual requests for batching.
